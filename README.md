# Kitchen-Sim-Multiplayer
Multiplayer version of the single player Kitchen Sim game I created from scratch
- WIP but demonstrates knowledge of multiplayer aspects of game development
- WASD to move
- E to interact with highlighted object
- F to chop
- How to setup Multiplayer (for now):
1. Run a clean build of the project
2. Run the .exe for Kitchen Sim Multiplayer as many times to create new windows
3. Host a game on one window
4. Join as a Client on the other window(s)
- Hosting is only available on your local machine for now
